##Timetable Sharing

**A MEAN based web application aimed at providing an easy to use way of comparing timetables**

Note that this has been initially setup in Visual Studio. Should be usable on any platform. 

**Testing to see if this has been initialised properly in Mac OS X**

Yep - Working! Should be good to go regardless of platform guys!
